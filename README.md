# QR-Code-Security

This code can be used to superimpose textures on QR Code in order to to make counterfeiting of QR Codes difficult.

---
First Stage: Generation of anti-counterfeiting texture
1. Gaussian Texture
2. Bilinear interpolation texture
3. Halftone texture
---
Second Stage: Refine QR Code  
Original QR Code -> Refined QR Code

---
Third Stage: fusion of the First and Second Stages  
Texture hidden anti-counterfeiting QR Code
